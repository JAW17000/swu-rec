		<h2>Welcome to SWU-REC</h2>
		<p>
			For starters, this is a fan-made website that is not affiliated with FFG
			or Star Wars Unlimited.
		</p>
		<p>
			I am a student in programming and data science that has a passion for SWU,
			to the point that I am combining the two. This website is a place for me to 
			practice new skills and support the community of the game. I hope you're able
			to make good use of the information that I was able to summarize.
		</p>
		<h3>What is SWU-REC?</h3>
		<p>
			SWU-REC is a frequency analysis. Or more simply, a guide to how frequently
			certain cards are used with certain leaders. In the back-end, I read scrape
			the internet for decklists periodically, and then run the numbers. For each
			leader, I count the cards that are used most commonly with that leader.
		</p>
		<h3>How do you use SWU-REC?</h3>
		<p>
			The link at the top of this page brings you to the home menu. From there,
			select a leader you would like to see the stats for. On that leader's page, 
			you will see cards separated into sections: Bases, Units, Events, and Upgrades.
			You will also see, near the top of the page, the four aspect symbols. Each aspect 
			symbol will redirect you to a separate page that displays the information for 
			cards used in decks with that aspect as the base (not ALL cards of that aspect).
			Each leader's page also shows you how many decklists I analyzed, and when the last
			time was that I updated the page.
		</p>
		<p>
			Each card on a leader's page shows you a percentage. For bases, the number is the 
			percentage of decks that use that base. For Units, Events and Upgrades, there are 
			four percentages. The first percentage tells you the same things as the bases, the
			percentage of decks that use that card. The next three numbers are a bit more specific.
			They tell you the percentage of decks that use X copies of that card. 
		</p>
		<h3>That's it! Enjoy</h3>
